About me
======

I'm a PhD student at the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/), Wharton School. My research centers on several interconnected themes, spanning probabilistic tool, statistical methodology and single-cell genomics. 

Statistically speaking, I work on methodological and theoretical problems in **hypothesis testing with complex data and its computational aspect.** Concretely speaking, my research centers on giving satisfactory and practical answer to scientific discovery. The particular challenges of cutting-edge application scenario can result from one or more of the following aspects:

- **Sensitivity to model specification**.
- **Large scale data due to technology advancement**.
- **Small signal-to-noise ratio due to sparsity or heavy tail**.

Recently, I am fascinated about single-cell genomics application, which has become a main driving force for my statistical research. I have been working with Prof. [Bhaswar B. Bhattacharya](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~bhaswar/) and [Eugene Katsevich](https://ekatsevi.github.io/) at Wharton.

In addition to research, I'm passionate about teaching and mentoring since I am deeply grateful for and benefit from the supervisors I have met, who have taught me far beyond just statistics. I have been a mentor for [Undergraduate Research in Probability and Statistics](https://sites.google.com/view/urps-penn?pli=1) and [Directed Reading Program](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~tbraz/drp/) at UPenn.
