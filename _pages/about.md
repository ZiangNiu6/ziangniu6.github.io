About me
======

I'm a master student at UPenn [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.upenn.edu/) majoring in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/). Mathematically, I am broadly interested in (applied) harmonic analysis (especially its connection with [kernel method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_method) in machine learning) and probability theory (especially its application in graph-based problem). Statistically, my [research](https://ziangniu6.github.io/research/) centers on several interconnected themes, spanning statistical theory and methodology. I work on methodological and theoretical problems in **high-dimensional inference and its interaction with causal inference, conditional independence testing, distribution-free nonparametric testing, and computational statistics.** 

In addition to research, I'm passionate about teaching and mentoring. I have been a mentor for [Undergraduate Research in Probability and Statistics](https://sites.google.com/view/urps-penn?pli=1) and [Directed Reading Program](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~tbraz/drp/) programs at UPenn.
