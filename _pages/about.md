About me
======

I'm a PhD student at the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/), Wharton School of Business. My research centers on several interconnected themes, spanning statistical theory and methodology. Recently, I am fascinated about single-cell genomics application, which becomes a main driving force for my statistical research.

I work on methodological and theoretical problems in **hypothesis testing with complex data and its computational aspect.** I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Bhaswar B. Bhattacharya](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~bhaswar/) and [Eugene Katsevich](https://ekatsevi.github.io/) on distribution-free nonparametric testing and conditional independent testing problems during my master. I was supervised by Dr. Wei Li and [Yuwen Gu](https://yuwen-gu.netlify.app/) for my undergraduate thesis. I was lucky to have Dr. [Fran√ßois-Xavier Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io/) as my research supervisor when I was an exchange student at UCL. My statistics research journey started during my visit to Prof. [Yi Yang](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/yyang/) when I was a sophomore student. 

In addition to research, I'm passionate about teaching and mentoring since I am deeply grateful for and benefit from the supervisors I have met, who have taught me far beyond just statistics. I have been a mentor for [Undergraduate Research in Probability and Statistics](https://sites.google.com/view/urps-penn?pli=1) and [Directed Reading Program](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~tbraz/drp/) at UPenn.
