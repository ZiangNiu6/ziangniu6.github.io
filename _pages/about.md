About me
======

I'm a master student at UPenn [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.upenn.edu/) majoring in [Applied Mathematics](https://www.amcs.upenn.edu/). My [research](https://katsevich-lab.github.io/) centers on several interconnected themes, spanning statistical theory, methodology. I work on methodological and theoretical problems in **high-dimensional inference and its interaction with causal inference, conditional independence testing, distribution-free nonparametric testing, combinatorial statistics, and computational statistics.**

In addition to research, I'm passionate about teaching and mentoring. I have been a mentor for [Undergraduate Research in Probability and Statistics](https://sites.google.com/view/urps-penn?pli=1) and [Directed Reading Program](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~tbraz/drp/) programs at UPenn.
